This folder should contain product images referenced by the app.

Place your luxury car images here with the following names (or update product image paths in `src/App.jsx`):
- car1.jpg  (Rolls-Royce Phantom)
- car2.jpg  (Bentley Continental GT)
- car3.jpg  (Ferrari Portofino)

You can replace these files with higher-resolution images. The app will load from `/images/car1.jpg`, etc.
